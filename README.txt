Hello Iker,

Be sure to have an internet connection while you use our app, we are using some CDN links (for Bootstrap, VueJS and a feature) which need internet to work.

To test the app, we have create 2 different users. One with the admin rights and the user one is just a basic user. You can test the app without user connection too. To see the 3 levels of user rights. You can also create your own user, which will automatically have the right of basic user.

The login of the superuser is : Admin
The password of the superuser is : IW2019

The login of the user is : User
The password of the user is : Deusto2019

Hello Iker,

The project is fully functional in our devices. If it doesn't work or if there's a problem with the virtual environments, maybe you could try to clone it from our GitHub repository.

Thomas, Arthur and Alexandre
